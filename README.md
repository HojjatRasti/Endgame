# Endgame

This is a creative twist on the classic **Hangman** game, built with **React.js** and **Vite**.  
Instead of the usual stick figure, each wrong guess eliminates a programming language from your stack. If you fail to guess the word before only Assembly remains to work with, you lose!

## Features

- Built with **React** and **Vite**
- Fun twist on the traditional Hangman game
- Programming languages used as the "lives"
- Clean and responsive UI for all devices
- Visual feedback for correct and incorrect guesses
- Replay option to start over with a new word

## Installation

To run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository:  
  `git clone https://github.com/Hoj80r/Endgame.git`

2. Navigate to the project folder:  
   `cd Endgame`

3. Install dependencies:  
   `npm install`

4. Start the development server using Vite:  
   `npm run dev`

The app will run at `http://localhost:5173` (or the port specified in your terminal).

## How it Works

1. A secret word is randomly selected.  
2. The player guesses letters one at a time.  
3. Each wrong guess removes a programming language (except HTML/CSS and frameworks).  
4. The game continues until the word is guessed or only Assembly remains.

## Technologies Used

- React.js (functional components, hooks)  
- Vite (fast build tool for React)  
- JavaScript (ES6)  
- HTML5 & CSS3
